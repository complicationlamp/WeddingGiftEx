Wedding gift exchange with ability to log user information
https://wedding-gift-exchange.herokuapp.com/

SUMMARY: The app is a way for useres to signup to take part in a small gift exchange at my wedding. As many of the guest are traveling in from outside of the state and country we wanted a way for guest to explain their culture to the other guest and hopefully produce some friendships along the way. 

THE API:  the api is set up to register and store user information and to randomly pair a user with another user also registered to the site. Users are not confined to the user they are matched with and can submit as many matches as the desier. 

TECHNOLOGY USED: This app is built with: HTML, CSS, JS Jquery, node, mocha and CHi (for testing), broserfy(to allow everything to render in a browser), Templating via EJS and styling with the use of Bootstrap. The app is tested with Travis CI, deployed via Heroku, and querys a database in Mlab.
